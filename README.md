# N-Body-Simulation

These Python notebooks simulate the dynamics of masses interacting under Newtonian gravity and animate the resulting simulation.  First run Numerical_N_Body_Simulator_V2.ipynb with the desired mass configurations.  The notebook will output a CSV file with the resulting positions across all time steps.  Then run Animation_Code.ipynb to create an animated plot like the one below:
