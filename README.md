# N-Body-Simulation
These Python notebooks
(1) simulate the dynamics of masses interacting under Newtonian gravity and
(2) animate a model of the Solar System.

To use them, first run Numerical_N_Body_Simulator_V2.ipynb with the desired mass configurations.  The notebook will output a CSV file with the resulting positions across all time steps.  Then run Animation_Code.ipynb to create an animated plot like the one below:
